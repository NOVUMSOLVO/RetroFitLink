# RetroFitLink Deployment Guide

This document outlines the deployment process for RetroFitLink to production environments.

## Deployment Strategy Overview

RetroFitLink uses a phased approach to ensure secure, reliable deployment to production:

1. Foundation & Security
2. Infrastructure & DevOps
3. Monitoring & Observability
4. Performance & Scalability

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Recommended Cloud Providers

- AWS
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure

### Key Infrastructure Components

- Application Load Balancer
- Container Orchestration (Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)
- Managed Database (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
- Redis Cache
- Object Storage
- CDN for frontend assets
- VPC with properly segmented subnets

## Security Measures

- Secret management using cloud provider services
- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing
- Role-based access control

## Monitoring & Observability

### Recommended Stack

- Application Performance Monitoring
- Error tracking
- Log aggregation
- Uptime monitoring
- Infrastructure metrics

### Critical Alerts Configuration

- API response time thresholds
- Error rate monitoring
- Database connection issues
- System resource utilization

## Deployment Pipeline

```text
Code Repository → CI/CD Pipeline → Staging Environment → Production Environment
```

### Pipeline Stages

1. Code quality checks (linting, testing)
2. Security scanning
3. Docker image building and scanning
4. Deployment to staging environment
5. Integration testing
6. Production deployment
7. Post-deployment verification

## Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal scaling for all services
- Database read replicas
- Cache implementation
- CDN for global distribution

## Post-Deployment Procedures

- Performance monitoring
- User feedback collection
- Regular security audits
- Capacity planning reviews

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups
- Multi-region redundancy
- Recovery procedure testing
